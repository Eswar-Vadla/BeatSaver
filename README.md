BeatSaver, a full-stack ML web app that not only predicts heart disease but also explains the "why" behind each prediction using my research: NS-XAI (Neuro-Symbolic Explainable AI).

Whatâ€™s Unique About BeatSaver?

Unlike traditional black-box models, BeatSaver uses NS-XAI to provide transparent, human-understandable explanations. It combines the power of a trained neural network with symbolic rules derived from medical expertise to explain predictions clearly.

Key Features:

- 13 health features (age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.)
- Trained deep learning model using TensorFlow + Keras
- Symbolic reasoning engine for real-time explanation generation
- Intuitive web UI with Tailwind CSS, animations, and a glassy effect

 Tech Stack:

- Backend: Python + Flask
- AI: TensorFlow, Keras + my NS-XAI logic
- Frontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS

NS-XAI: My Research Contribution NS-XAI is a hybrid approach that I proposed and implemented to bring clarity to AI models. BeatSaver is one of its first real-world applications â€” combining ML predictions with symbolic medical rules to generate natural-language explanations.
